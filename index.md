### CPSC 120


* Lab 3 

    Lab 3 was interesting to do as it taught me how to calcualte the date difference between two specific dates using the Julian Day calander. It taught me how to call void functions as well as other functions as well. Looking back, it wasn't hard to do but it was a fun and helped me what I needed to improve on more.


* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a fun lab to do as we made a guessing game between two players where Player 1 inputs a secret number while Player 2 has two guesses to find out what Player 1's secret number is. The use of if statements and an else statement was crucial to the completion of the lab. The lab itself wasn't too difficult but it helped me understand the use of if and else statements even more.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs as it taught us how to use && and || properly. The parking unit lab was fun to do too as it helped me also understand boolean more with the true and false on when you are allowed to park on certain streets and when you're not allowed to park as well. Though there were some problems, my partner and I managed to find what the problem was and fix it.
